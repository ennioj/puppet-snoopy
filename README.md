##Development

Rentabiliweb  modules on  the  Puppet  Forge are  open  projects, and  community
contributions are  essential for keeping  them great.  We can’t access  the huge
number  of   platforms  and  myriad   of  hardware,  software,   and  deployment
configurations that  Puppet is intended to  serve so feel free  to contribute on
GitHub.
